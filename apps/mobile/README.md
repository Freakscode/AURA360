# aura_mobile

A new Flutter project.

## Development shortcuts

- Add the project helper scripts to your path before the Flutter SDK: `export PATH="$PWD/tool:$PATH"`.
- Run `flutter run dev [--lan [--lan-interface en0|...] [--lan-ip <addr>]]` to launch the app with environment defines from `env/local.env`, optional LAN rewrites, and interactive device selection when multiple targets are connected.
- Use `tool/run_dev.sh` directly if you prefer to call the helper without touching your `PATH`.
